What questions do you have about the data?

a)Is the data aggragated from multiple sources? 
b)Do we have flexibility to validate JSON File at source itself?
c)Do we flexibility make changes to to data model without hindering day to day operations?


How did you discover the data quality issues?

Upon inspection during modelling there seems to be denormalised table receipt in  database leading to inefficient querying 
which can cause complications and inaccurate results.

What do you need to know to resolve the data quality issues?

A separate rewardsReceiptItemList table can be created from exisiting receipts table to resolve performance issues and ensure accurate results.

What other information would you need to help you optimize the data assets you're trying to create?

 A clear connection between recipt and recipt Item list would help in effecient Data modelling.
 Missing Items in receiptItem List would reduce errors.
 Possibility of validating data at source would reduce performance issues.


What performance and scaling concerns do you anticipate in production and how do you plan to address them?

The dataset in the current format will lead to scaling issues, as the receipts.json file has reduant rewardsItemListList 
that will lead to scaling issues and hence propose to make a separte table for rewardsItemList will lead to faster searching 
better scalability and performance.
